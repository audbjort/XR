## Companies
Eye-tracking:
* Fove: 
a kickstarter-funded project, is the first VR headset to have embedded eye-tracking. Others are not far behind.
* Eyefluence 
acquired by Google
* Eye Tribe 
acquired by Facebook
* SMI
A leader in eye tracking technology, has initiated several partnerships and projects to bring eye tracking to both standalone VR head-mounted displays and smartphone slot-ins.

## Data
The high-fidelity video capture that allows viewers to move around a video scene as if they were requires massive amounts of computing - every frame of video is 3GB.

## Fovea
The part of the retina that can see significant detail

 ## Foveated rendering
 Eye tracking technology is key to foveated rendering, a technique where only the portion of the image that lands on the fovea (the part of the retina that can see significant detail) is rendered in full quality.

## FPS Frames Per Second
FPS stand for frames per second, a measurement for how many unique consecutive images a camera can handle each second. Digital cameras comparaison: low-end digital still cameras typically have a frame rate of 1fps. High end digital video cameras typically have a frame rate of 30fps. 

## Headset type
Tethered: The headset connects to a desktop/ps or a playstation and renders applications like games, social, etc. on the desktop

Mobile: The headset connects to a mobile phone and reders app content.

## Khronos VR API
The VR standard

## Neurons
A neuron is a nerve cell. The human brain is made up of approximately 100 billion neurons. A neuron has inputs called dendrites and outputs called axons.

## VR Challanges
* Headache, queasiness, blurred vision, etc.
* Bulky and heavy
* Pricey
* Some VR urge adults to take at least 10-minute breaks every half-hour, and they warn against driving, riding a bike or operating machinery if the user feels odd after a session.
* Resolution
